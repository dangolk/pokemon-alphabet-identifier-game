Inspired by Wes Bos' Drumkit project

As of 03/05/2018, only speaks pokemon names when key is pressed

1. Future update will include a tetris like animation of text and alphabets across the screen
2. When key is pressed, score goes up.
3. Random background with random pokemon every single time

Possible game scenarios:
1. Static background with 10 - 15 pokemons
  1. Timer is on and counting down
  2. Player has to identify all pokemon present in the picture.
  3. With every correct identification, points are scored and pokemon in the picture remains highlighted until level is complete
  4. Random picture with random pokemon every single time
  5. Moving alphabets on the screen, choose some and disregard the unused ones that serve as a distraction
2. Check pokemon-grid-game.png for another interesting game project
  1.Leaderboard style game
  2. 3 rows: L | C | R. L and R have pokemon. C has trainer name
  3. Once you click on one of C (trainer), you have to guess which pokemons these trainers use, shown in columns L and R.
